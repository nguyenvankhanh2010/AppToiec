# YouTube Video Playback Implementation

## Overview

This update adds support for playing YouTube videos in the English Learning App. Previously, the app could only play local videos or videos from direct file URLs, but now it can properly handle YouTube links like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYgLjdSkXE.

## What's Changed

1. **Added WebView for YouTube Videos**
   - Modified the `activity_video_player.xml` layout to include a WebView
   - The WebView loads YouTube videos using an embedded iframe
   - The app detects YouTube links and switches between WebView and VideoView as needed

2. **Enhanced Network Security**
   - Added network security configuration to allow secure connections to YouTube-related domains
   - Updated the AndroidManifest.xml to reference this configuration

3. **Documentation Added**
   - Added comprehensive guide for YouTube integration (see `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_INTEGRATION.md`)
   - Added implementation summary (see `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`)

## How to Test

1. Launch the app and navigate to a lesson that uses a YouTube video URL
2. The app should detect the YouTube URL and play it in the WebView
3. Test different YouTube URL formats:
   - Standard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYgLjdSkXE
   - Short: https://youtu.be/kFYgLjdSkXE
   - Embedded: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFYgLjdSkXE

## Known Limitations

- Limited control over video playback (cannot get position, duration)
- No direct access to YouTube player controls
- No easy way to detect when video finishes playing
- Limited ability to control playback quality

## Future Improvements

For better YouTube integration, consider:

1. **Using the YouTube Android Player API**
   - The WebView approach is functional but limited
   - The YouTube API offers more control and better user experience
   - Follow the guide in `YOUTUBE_PLAYER_INTEGRATION.md` for implementation details

2. **Adding Custom Controls**
   - Add fullscreen toggle
   - Add quality selection options
   - Add more precise playback control

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with YouTube video playback:

1. **Video doesn't play**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify that URLs are not malformed
   - Check for missing internet permissions

2. **Security warnings**
   - Ensure all YouTube content is loaded over HTTPS
   - Check the network security configuration
